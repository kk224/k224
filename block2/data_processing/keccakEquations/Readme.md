# 59ori.txt
The system generated by the first message block with n = 59 is contained in '59ori.txt'. This system is generated based on the outputs of the first block, and it also needs adjustments described in Section 4.2 to deal with Type I unsatisfied equations. We made adjustments by hand in our experiments. x0\~x639 stand for the unknowns in (a) of the 1st round in Figure 8. For example, A_{x=0, y=0, z=3}, A_{x=1, y=0, z=0}, and A_{x=0, y=2, z=0} are represented by x3, x64, and x320 respectively. x700\~x736 refer to 37 variables to be enumerated, and they come from the sums of Column 0 or 2 in (a) of the 2nd round in Figure 8 as well as orange bits in Figure 11 and 12. 


# 59param.txt
Reducing the quadratic polynomials by all linear polynomials leads to new nonlinear polynomials, which are included in '59param.txt'. The reduction can be done by running './F4_param_b2' directly, or using any computer algebra system, e.g. Magma. The monomial ordering is x0 > x1 > .... 

# 59rename.txt
For convenience, the variables x700\~x736 in polynomials of '59param.txt' are renamed as x0\~x36.

# 59totalLinear.txt
Polynomials in '59totalLinear.txt' are generated by running './F4_param_b2', and they are used to verify the solutions.

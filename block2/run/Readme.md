# data/*
Files of matrices generated by 'data_processing' procedure.

# main.cu
Source file of the algorithm for solving linear systems using GPU.

# keccak224r3b2_59
Executable file of 'main.cu'.

# How to use keccak224r3b2_59?

keccak224r3b2_59 reads the files in 'data/', and solves the system w.r.t. given values of x0\~x36. 

The command is below:

    $ chmod 777 keccak224r3b2_59
    $ ./keccak224r3b2_59 r device_id

where r is a non-negative integer indicating the index of searching space, and device_id refers to the ID of the GPU card. 


Theoretically, all the values of x0\~x36 can be enumerated, and in our implementation, each searching space contains 2^29 of these values. 
If r ranges from 0 to 2^8 - 1, then all the values of x0\~x36 are enumerated.   


# The outputs

The results of solution are saved in 'preimage_b2_59.txt'.
And the messaged state of the 2nd block in hex will be print to the screen at the same time. The 2nd block message is achieve by XORing the output state of the 1st block with this messaged state.

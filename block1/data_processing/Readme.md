# Converting polynomials to matrices.

To speed up the computations, we convert polynomials to matrices. The details are quite complex, we only illustrate the main idea here. For more details, please see the codes in 'Mat/'.

Assume 
<code>
 x0x1+x2(x3+x5+x451)+x3(x4+x448+x449+x450)+x4(x5+x448+1)+x5+x449+x450+1
</code> is a polynomial in '224rename.txt'. The values of x0\~x5 are to be enumerated, and the values of x448\~x451 are to be solved. We transform this polynomial in the following form:
<code>
 x2x451+x3(x448+x449+x450)+x4(x448+1)+(x449+x450+1)+x0x1+x2(x3+x5)+x3x4+x4x5+x5.
</code> This polynomial becomes linear if the values of x0\~x5 are enumerated. Note that the linear polynomials x451, x448+x449+x450, x448+1, x449+x450+1 are independent with the values of x0\~x5, so we can store the coefficients of these linear polynomials as fixed rows of matrices. For enumerating the values of x0\~x5, an ordering like Gray code is used, such that only one value in x0\~x5 is changed each time. In such a way, the linear polynomial after the specialization of x0\~x5 can be obtained efficiently.

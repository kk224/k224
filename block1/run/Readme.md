# How to use b1_keccak224r3?

b1_keccak224r3 reads the files in 'data/', and solves the system w.r.t. given values of x0\~x63. A value of 'bound' is output during the computation, which is the largest number of equations that hold. 

The command is below:

    $ chmod 777 b1_keccak224r3
    $ ./b1_keccak224r3 r device_id

where r is a non-negative integer indicating the index of searching space, and device_id refers to the ID of the GPU card. 

Theoretically, all the values of x0\~x63 can be enumerated, and in our implementation, each searching space contains 2^32 of these values. If r ranges from 0 to 2^32 - 1, then all the values of x0\~x63 are enumerated.


# The outputs

The results are saved in 'result.txt', in the form of: 

    bound:57
    val:804781053958317751,sol:14749803852520583477,count:57(bound:57)
    val:11101 10101 10011 00110 01001 10100 11010 11000 00010 10011 01010 01101 0000

The value

    val:11101 10101 10011 00110 01001 10100 11010 11000 00010 10011 01010 01101 0000

is the binary form of `804781053958317751`, and it corresponds to the values of x0\~x63:

    x0=1,
    x1=1,
    x2=1,
    x3=0,
    x4=1,
    ...
    
This output means that 57 nonlinear equations hold if the values of x0\~x63 are set like above. With these known values, the original system can be solved easily, and hence, the 1st message block is achieved.
